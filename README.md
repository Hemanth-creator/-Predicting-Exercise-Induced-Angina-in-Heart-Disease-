# Predicting Exercise Induced Angina in Heart Disease
## Overview
This project aims to predict heart disease based on exercise-induced angina using various machine learning models. Exercise-induced angina is chest discomfort or pain that occurs when the heart muscle doesnâ€™t get enough oxygen-rich blood during physical exertion, a symptom of coronary artery disease. By analyzing features such as age, gender, chest pain type, and more, we build predictive models to identify individuals at risk of heart disease.

## Data
The dataset used in this project includes information such as:

- Age: Age of the patient.
- Sex: Gender of the patient (1 for male, 0 for female).
- ChestPainType: Type of chest pain experienced (categorical).
- RestingBP: Resting blood pressure.
- Cholesterol: Serum cholesterol level.
- FastingBS: Fasting blood sugar level.
- RestingECG: Resting electrocardiogram results.
- MaxHR: Maximum heart rate achieved.
- ExerciseAngina: Exercise-induced angina (1 for yes, 0 for no).
- Oldpeak: Depression induced by exercise relative to rest.
- HeartDisease: Target variable indicating the presence (1) or absence (0) of heart disease.

## Libraries Used
- numpy
- pandas
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- scikit-learn
- xgboost
- lightgbm

## Data Preprocessing
- Loading Data: The data is read from a CSV file.
- Removing Duplicates: Duplicate rows are identified and removed.
- One-Hot Encoding: Categorical variables (ChestPainType) are converted into dummy variables.

## Models
The following classifiers are evaluated:
- Logistic Regression
- Random Forest
- Support Vector Machine (SVM)
- XGBoost
- LightGBM
- Gradient Boosting
- Extra Trees

## Model Training and Evaluation
Each model is trained and evaluated on a test set. 

## Performance metrics include:
- Accuracy: Fraction of correctly predicted instances.
- Precision: Ratio of true positive predictions to the total predicted positives.
- Recall: Ratio of true positive predictions to the total actual positives.
- F1 Score: Harmonic mean of precision and recall.

## Results
The models are compared based on their performance metrics. The results indicate that the Extra Trees classifier performed the best among the models evaluated.

## Conclusion
This project demonstrates the use of various machine learning techniques for predicting heart disease based on exercise-induced angina. The Extra Trees classifier achieved the highest performance in terms of accuracy and F1 score.
